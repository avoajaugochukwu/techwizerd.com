[{"content":"Hugo blog is becoming one of the most popular static site generators.\nThe first time I used it, I was blown away by how easy it was to set up a blog on my local machine. It is also very easy to publish your hugo site to github Pages for free.\nIn this tutorial, I am going to show you how to set up your hugo blog on Github Pages. We would be using this theme . You do not need to pay for hosting or provide your credit card details.\nStep 1: Installing Hugo on your windows machine. You can get Hugo by using Chocolatey. Chocolatey is a windows package manager.\nAfter installing Chocolatey, you can go on to Hugo website, for instructions on how to install Hugo.\nYou can also install it directly from Github. If you do not want to install Chocolatey.\nStep 2: Creating a new project After installing Hugo, type hugo in your cmd to ensure that it is working.\nhugo If it was successfully installed, we can go ahead and start a new site in a directory of your choice.\nhugo new site test.com -f yml This code creates a new site called test and forces it to use yml format for its' config file, which is more readable than toml files. It also creates a folder called test that will house all our hugo resources.\nYou should see a message like so:\nCongratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in C:\\computer\\Hugo\\test.com Just a few more steps and you're ready to go: 1. Download a theme into the same-named folder. Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or create your own with the \u0026quot;hugo new theme \u0026lt;THEMENAME\u0026gt;\u0026quot; command. 2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files with \u0026quot;hugo new \u0026lt;SECTIONNAME\u0026gt;\\\u0026lt;FILENAME\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;FORMAT\u0026gt;\u0026quot;. 3. Start the built-in live server via \u0026quot;hugo server\u0026quot;. Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation. Step 3: Add a Hugo theme As discussed earlier, hugo has a lot of themes that makes development easy. We would use the PaperMod theme.\nRun the following code one after the other in your command prompt.\ncd test.com git init git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod --depth=1 This code changes directory to the newly created test.com. It initializes git in the current folder. And pulls the PaperMod theme from github into the themes/PaperMod folder.\nYour directory should now look like this.\nNext visit PaperMod installation page and copy the content of the sampe config.yml. Replace the overwrite the original content of the config.yml file, which is in the root of our test.com folder.\nThen run this is your command prompt.\nhugo server This will start the hugo server, visit the localhost URL where hugo says the site is running. And you should se this.\nThis is the default home of the PaperMod theme.\nStep 4: Add pages To add pages Run the command:\nhugo new posts/html.md This creates a new folder called posts and a new markdown file called html.md.\nThe file should have a title, date and draft status.\nChange the draft status to false or delete that line.\nCopy the text below into the html.md file for test purposes.\n  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.\n  Run in the command prompt\nhugo server -D The -D flag, tells the server to also show drafts. Because our html post has draft set to true. You can set draft to false, or remove that line entirely. Then you do not need the -D flag anymore.\n Note that drafts will not be added to the site when we build it later.\n You should see that our first post has been added.\nAt this point we are ready to move our blog to Github pages.\nStep 5: Set up repository Firstly, in the config.yml file, add this line publishDir: \u0026quot;docs\u0026quot; after theme: PaperMod. This tells hugo to store the publish our site into the directory called docs, when we build.\nThen run:\nhugo -t PaperMod This builds our site into the docs folder.\nVisit your github profile and create a new repository called test.com.\nFrom our test.com directory on our local machine. Run the following code:\ngit remote add origin \u0026lt;repository URL\u0026gt; git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial Commit\u0026quot; git push origin master This code adds a remote url to our repository, adds and commits our work. Then finally pushes it to our remote repository.\nStep 6: Github Pages From the new repository, click on settings then scroll down to the github pages section.\nFor source, select branch as master and change /(root) to docs, then save.\nAfter saving, scroll down back to the github pages section, then copy the new URL that github has provided. That is where our website is located. We would copy this URL into our config.yml file.\nIn the config.yml file replace the value for baseURL with the github page link we just copied.\nThen run the following code:\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Updated baseURL\u0026quot; git push origin master This updates the remote repository with our latest changes.\nAt this stage, when you visit the Github Pages URL, you should see the site we just built.\nThat is how we connect Hugo to Github Pages.\nThe benefit is that you can write your posts locally in markdown, and once you push to the remote repository, you website will be updated automatically.\nIf you would like to host your website on your own domain.
